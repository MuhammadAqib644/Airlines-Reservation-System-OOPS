# Airlines-Reservation-System-OOPS
This C++ program simulates a comprehensive reservation system for Pakistan International Airlines (PIA). It uses object-oriented principles like inheritance, polymorphism, and templates to manage passengers, flights, and seat availability. The program supports domestic and international flight bookings, cancellation of last booked flights, receipt generation, and displaying passenger details. It also includes features like flight type differentiation, seat availability tracking, and a linked list implementation to manage a dynamic list of booked flights. This code serves as an excellent example of applying OOP concepts to real-world scenarios.
